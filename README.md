This system serves as a guide for the consumers to choose best
product at best price. Different websites have different prices for a
product. Price of product may differ from website to website. In this
case consumer has to search all the websites to select the price of
the product which appeals to his/her taste. This is time consuming
process. This product recommendation system helps consumers
select the product which has different prices on different e-
commerce websites by displaying them on a single webpage. It
makes use of web-scraping technology. It also saves user
preferences so that you never loose what you searched for.
